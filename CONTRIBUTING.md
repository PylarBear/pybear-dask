## Contributing To pybear-dask

pybear-dask is not actively seeking contributions. This package is a spin-off 
of dask functionality that was once part of pybear and is not under active
development.

If you have a good idea that uses dask, it may be better to try to contribute
directly to
[dask](https://image.dask.org/en/latest/contributing.html>) or
[dask-ml](https://ml.dask.org/contributing.html>).

Otherwise, if you have a contribution that is pertinent to pybear, visit the
[pybear homepage](https://github.com/PylarBear/pybear).
